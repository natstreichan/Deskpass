    Systems like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are the end result of years and years of effort spent slowly abstracting server resources from being "a single physical machine your app is running on" to "a distributed pool of generic resources any app can run on." What do you think the next level of server abstraction will look like in 10 years? How will web apps be deployed and managed a decade from now? Will container management systems such as Kubernetes still be used, or will there be another layer of abstraction used?
    
Kubernetes' platform automation ensures that application deployment, resiliency and scalability can be made simple. The ability to pursue the desired state of execution is a powerful mechanism for keeping an application running as expected. Kubernetes enables large-scale use of containers, which increases infrastructure usage efficiency. Some users even report gains of 30% to 40% in terms of cost reduction. The combination of Containers and Kubernetes is revolutionizing the datacenter and enabling a new IT model that makes us rethink software development paradigms. The results demonstrate that it is worth the effort and investment.
Kubernetes becomes an underlying infrastructure layer that is built on-top of by everything else. So small projects might use what appears to be a simple, streamlined PaaS (or FaaS like Knative), but that PaaS will be k8s under the hood. I’m somewhat skeptical that this will achieve mass adoption due to the amount of resources required by Kubernetes and the tendency for Kubernetes complexities to “show through”. It may be simpler and far more efficient to distill the best bits of k8s into a new system - we are seeing a lot of exploratory work here like k3s, KCP and badidea. On a side-note, internal platforms and tooling like Humanitec, Backstage and Crossplane will become commonplace at large organisations, and this won’t go away even if Kubernetes does.
